# neurosity-web-app-demo
A demo version of the [neurosity-web-app](https://github.com/WilliamLa59/neurosity-web-app) I worked on for The School of Occupational and Public Health @ Toronto Metropolitan University.

I've omitted the server and this is essentially just a refactored version of the client side code without the requirement of an official [Nuerosity Crown](https://neurosity.co/). This demo version feeds static dummy data to the application in place of the Crown while still being able to perform its main functionalities.
